1) Open Data Projects
We’ve come up with questions & areas of interest, and starting to find data sets —> now what? 
Can use Jupyter Notebook (or Excel) to process everything
:: Next step: figure out our ETL process - Rob mentioned tools like Amazon Glue, Amazon Athena… (both new / in beta)

 
2) Talking Over Linda’s Work w/ Log Files
Rob: check out Amazon Athena - very good service for easily getting to data analysis & querying data
Only released in November last year


3) Housekeeping
For the summer months, considering a hiatus from the monthly meet ups at EPL - maybe get together more casually on a patio with cold drinks instead
Alec will withdraw as co-organizer - will announce it to the Meetup mailing list


Moving Forward
Future presentation ideas: 
People can play around with new tools Rob has been finding: 
Jupyter Notebook, KNIME, RapidMiner, GenMyModel, Verkabelt
George: cases where you have a queue & want to set up KPI’s
Joshua Bragge: next meeting
Side project from Rob: help parsing huge JSON blob
Gerry offered to help
Alec’s old ideas
Start G-Sheet of RSVPs vs attendance; repeat attendees
Send out survey to members —> OR, QUESTIONS FOR NEW MEMBERS ON MEETUP
What time commitment do you expect? 
Suggestions for locations (w/ good parking)
How competent do you feel, working on project
What are you interested in learning / doing
Do you have access to cool data sets?
