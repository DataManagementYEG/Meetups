1) Presentation
Goals for this meet up
Learn from each other in a safe space
Use tools that aren’t from the ‘90s - esp new tools in the cloud
Learn & build our skills with all this by actually working on practical projects
Our niche, relative to other data meetups in YEG: we’ll clean & organize data (using that as our means of learning tools & practices) - we target a step earlier in the pipeline than other groups, who want cleaned-up datasets to work with/on


2) Tools We’re Familiar With
Heng - R, Excel
Joe - Octave, 
Simon - Elk, Spark, Hadoop, ‘small data guy’
François - Splunk*, Hadoop
George - MungoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle
Nancy - SQL Server, starting some AWS
Marc - MatLab, 
Linda - R, command-line
Alec - Excel, Python, R
*Splunk (used w/ Hadoop) - but expensive, commercial


3) What Are Our Goals?
Linda - working w/ GIS data (e.g. WEM crime, parks)
Alec, Lilian
Marc - learning everything!
Alec, Lilian
Joe - working with anonymized data
Good datasets: Edmonton Open Data, AHS (Simon), 


Questions / Discussion
Do we overlap a lot with Data 4 Good?
What we want to do is clean up & organize data - so we can work on the data sets, and then D4G uses them
Can you give a concrete example of what data management is?
Rob shared stories from work projects
Concerns that we’re not starting our work with a question… often, that’s how projects begin
Edmonton contact suggested starting w/ Transportation as an area of interest


Moving Forward
Our future meetings will be 1st Monday of the month
Careful not to conflict w/ Startup Edmonton Python (2nd Monday of the month)
Everyone: visit Edmonton Open Data —> choose 1-2 datasets of interest
Try data profiling - tools to use: 
Can use Tableau Public for free
Trifecta Wrangler is free too
